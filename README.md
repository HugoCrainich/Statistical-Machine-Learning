# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my academic and technical portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. It documents my work applying modern data science methods to core economic questions, with a strong emphasis on rigor, interpretability, and real-world relevance.

## About This Portfolio

I am an undergraduate economics student preparing for roles in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**. This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my ability to **bridge traditional economic theory with modern machine learning techniques**.

The course follows a **Concept Extension** approach: we begin with foundational statistical and econometric tools—such as linear regression, inference, and causal analysis—and extend them using machine learning algorithms like **regularization methods (e.g., Lasso)** and predictive models.

Rather than treating machine learning as a black box, this work emphasizes:
- Combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Maintaining interpretability and economic intuition
- Critically evaluating assumptions, bias, and model performance

This framework mirrors how data science is increasingly applied in economics, policy analysis, and industry settings.
