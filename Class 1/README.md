## 🌍 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

### Objective
To empirically test the **Law of One Price** by applying Burgernomics to evaluate whether exchange rates align with relative price levels across countries.

### Methodology
- Constructed a structured dataset using manually defined Python dictionaries based on *The Economist*’s 2015 Big Mac Index data  
- Calculated **implied Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates** by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. benchmark  
- Computed **currency misalignment percentages** to measure overvaluation or undervaluation relative to the U.S. dollar  
- Analyzed deviations from PPP as evidence of market frictions, pricing rigidities, and limits to arbitrage  

### Key Findings
The analysis revealed substantial deviations from Purchasing Power Parity across countries. 
Several currencies displayed persistent **overvaluation** or **undervaluation** against the U.S. dollar, 
suggesting that nominal exchange rates do not fully adjust to equalize purchasing power. 
These disparities highlight the presence of transaction costs, non-tradable inputs, 
and structural economic differences that limit international **arbitrage** and prevent strict adherence to the Law of One Price.
